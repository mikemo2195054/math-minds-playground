    <h2>Why only know "what" when you can know "why"?</h2>
    <p>Math Minds Playground is a special project with various games that help you learn math in a fun way. Our main aim
        is to find out more about why things work in math, not just knowing what we learn in school. We want to go
        beyond memorizing and really understand the reasons behind mathematical ideas. This project takes a different
        approach compared to school by exploring the "why" instead of just focusing on the "what" you usually study in
        class.</p>
